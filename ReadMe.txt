Humana Coding Assessment ReadMe

Within this app you'll find the solution to the client's requirements stated below:
using vs code, write a c# solution to take in an input of a paragraph and:
give the number of palindrome words
give the number of palindrome sentences
list the unique words of a paragraph with the count of the word instance
let the user also input a letter at some point and list all words containing that letter

Within the Main() method you'll find most of the text UI that will be displayed to the counsel. Some times the program
will ask you to hit enter or enter a letter. Follow the prompts and I'm sure you'll figure it out.

I have developed 4 key functions, along with a few supplementary functions, to aid in solving these problems.

I have included an example paragraph with a mix of words that are both palindromes and not palindromes and a mix of sentances
that are both palindromes and not palindromes. My functions will take this paragraph and determine the required data.

Some key strategies to note are the use of loops to look through strings, lists and arrays to easily skim the data. Using regular 
expressions to manipulate the data by getting rid of punctuation or spacing, for example. Converting string[] to char[] allowed for
the ability to utilize Reverse to check for a palindrome. 

I hope you enjoy my program.
